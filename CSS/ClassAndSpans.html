                Nearly all browsers nowadays support CSS and many other applications do, too. To write CSS, you don't need more than a text editor, but there are many tools available that make it even easier. Of course, all software has bugs, even after several updates. And some programs are further ahead implementing the latest CSS modules than others. Various sites describe bugs and work-arounds.

                And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
                And looked down one as far as I could<br>
                To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
                <br>
                Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
                And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
                Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
                Though as for that the passing there<br>
                Had worn them really about the same,<br>

                In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
                Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
                Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
                I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
